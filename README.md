# [MIPOT](https://www.mipot.com) C library for Single and Dual Core [MIP](https://mipot.com/en/products/?cat=110) Series modules.

The MIP Series is a family transceivers operating in the 868 MHz SRD Band (EU Version) or 915 MHz (US Version), optimized for very long range and low power applications.

The Series B/C/D are based on LoRaÂ® RF Technology, providing ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity. 

The A Serie is based on the new wM-BUS OMS 2 protocol stack. The module supports various operating modes (S, T, R, C) to meet the requirements of one-way and two-way data communication, in stationary and mobile systems.
